# UI & Data Handling (v1.2)

## UI Standards
- Use modern frameworks (React, Vue) with TypeScript
- Implement dark mode, responsive design, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Use design tokens and component libraries
- Include loading, error, and empty states in all components
- Use Storybook for component documentation
- Design review and handoff via Figma or Zeplin
- Preferred state management: Redux, Zustand, or Context API
- For environment consistency, use Python virtual environments (`venv`), nvm-windows for Node.js, .env files for configuration, and pre-commit hooks. Automate setup and checks with cross-platform scripts (e.g., Python, Justfile). Use CI/CD pipelines for reproducible builds and tests. (No Docker required.)

## Data Fetching
- Use SWR or similar for client-side data fetching
- Fetch data inline in server components
- Use server actions for mutations
- Handle errors with user feedback (toasts, alerts)
- Never mock data in dev/prod, only in tests
- Handle API versioning and breaking changes in data contracts with clear documentation and migration guides
